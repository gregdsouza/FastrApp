          <p>Welcome to Fastr! Fastr, Inc. (“Fastr”) provides these Terms of Service (the “Terms”), which govern your access to and use of Fastr, our mobile consumer to business customer service and communication services, which are accessible via our website located at <a href="/">https://Fastr.co</a> (collectively, the “Site”) and our mobile device application (“App”).  To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services and App are collectively called the “Services.” </p><h3>Agreement to Terms</h3><p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services. </p><h3>Changes to Terms or Services</h3><p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can’t use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p><h3>Who May Use the Services</h3><p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p><p>You may use the Services only if you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. </p><p><strong>Registration and Your Information</strong></p><p>If you want to use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account (“Account”). You can do this via the Services.  It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p><h3>Using Fastr</h3><p>Via the Services, consumers can communicate with business via in-Services text messaging.  Businesses which have agreed to the terms of our Customer Agreement can create profiles via the Services for such businesses and make available one or more employees (“Business Users”) to receive messages from consumers.  If you register to use the Services and create an Account, we will create a profile for your use of the Services which contains a profile picture (that you can upload or make available via the Services) and your name (if you are a Business User, your profile may also contain your job title and business address and logo).  When you choose to communicate with a Business User via the Services, we will share the content of your communication with the applicable Business User, along with your name and profile picture.  Such Business Users may respond to your comment or question directly via the Services, or may contact you via the Services on behalf of the applicable business to send you marketing materials or other materials that may be of interest to you, as described in further detail in our Privacy Policy. </p><h3>Feedback</h3><p>We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”).

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>IN NO EVENT WILL Fastr’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Fastr AND YOU. </p><h3>Dispute Resolution</h3><p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p><p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p><p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p><p>You and Fastr agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and Fastr are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Fastr otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Rules</strong></p><p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">http://www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Process</strong></p><p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong></p><p>Unless you and Fastr otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Fastr submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><p><strong>Arbitrator’s Decision</strong></p><p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Fastr will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p><p><strong>Fees</strong></p><p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Fastr will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p><p><strong>Changes</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Fastr changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to contact@Fastr.co) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Fastr’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Fastr in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p><h3>General Terms</h3><p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Fastr and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Fastr and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p><p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Fastr’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Fastr may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>Any notices or other communications provided by Fastr under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by Fastr: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p><p>Fastr’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Fastr. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@Fastr.co">contact@Fastr.co</a> if you have any questions about our Terms of Service.</p>
